            <h1>My Experience</h1>
                <p>My education in programming consists of Codecademy, The Odin Project, Free Code Camp, and mentoring from several software programmers in my area. I have chosen to pursue a personal education, so that I can fully develop my skills on my own time, and develop a more through understanding of the topic, without the crippling student loan debt. The languages I am familiar with are:</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What makes you want to become a full stack developer?</strong> I have always been interested in not only the design aspect of the items we use everyday, but also on what goes on behind the scenes that most people will never think twice about. I want to be able to develop both of these aspects of technology into the future.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why don't you just go to college to get a computer science degree?</strong> While I have considered college as an option, my ability to learn in my own enviroment  at an accelerated and comfy pace has always benefited me more than any instituted education. At home, I am able to learn faster, be more creative, and have more individualized lessons from those who are teaching me. Also student loans.</li>
                    <li><strong>What kind of Technology are you interested in?</strong> I am interested in anything space-related, automation of the industrial world, computer/mobile website front and backend based, and car based tech.</li>
                    <li><strong>What could you offer that most candidates for the same job can not?</strong> I offer strong interpersonal skills that I have acquired from my highschool career, a devotion to solving problems, and a creative and unique output to every problem that I come across.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong> In 5 years, I see myself as a full-stack developer for a small to medium company, but with my own real-estate business and apartment complex funded by my career in development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Greatest Achivement?</strong> My awards from the NJROTC Program at Laurens High School (all 15)</li>
